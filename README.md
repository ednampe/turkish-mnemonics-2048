## Acknowledgments

This word list was created by filtering 92,000 Turkish words to remove those containing Turkish-specific characters (ç, ğ, ı, ö, ş, ü) for better compatibility across various systems. Following the BIP39 standard, only words between 3 and 6 characters were selected. The resulting 8,497 words were then analyzed using the Turkish frequency list contributed to by Boğaziçi University (available at https://github.com/savasy/TurkishWordFreq). The final list comprises the 2048 most frequently used Turkish words that meet these criteria.

Special thanks to the contributors of the TurkishWordFreq project for providing the frequency data that made this selection possible.
